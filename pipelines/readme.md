In this part, you will implement multiple pipelines. All the needed commands are discussed in the lectures and can be found on the slides.


This part consists of two sections:
- Firstly, you will use some pipelines to do text analysis and manipulation in [mybook.sh](<mybook.sh>).
- Secondly, you will use some pipelines to help you find information in log files in [logParsing.sh](<logParsing.sh>).
