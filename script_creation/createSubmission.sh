# The Unix assignment is almost over: time to create a submission.
# You could create a zip folder by hand. Just place the `.sh` files in there... But where's the fun in that?
# Let's create a script that does this for us.
# This script should take an output name as the first parameter.
# If called in a directory, it should recursively find all the `.sh` files and add them to a zip folder.
# The zip folder should only contain `.sh` files and no folders.
