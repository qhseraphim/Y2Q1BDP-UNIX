# This program should take a fileIn as the first parameter:
# It takes the input log file that has the same format as the `access_log` file and maps it to a CSV format.
# The CSV format is:
# Client,Time,Type,Path,Status,Size
#
# The program should not create a CSV file.
# This can be done by piping the output to a file.
# Example: `./logToCSV access_log > output.csv`
# It could take some time to convert all of the `access_log` file contents. Consider using a small subset for testing.
